    <h2>Definitions:</h2>

    <p><strong>"You," "Your," "User"</strong> refers to the individual (or entity) using the app and its services.</p>

    <p><strong>"Amount"</strong> refers to the monetary value payable by the Company to the User for the recyclable materials, calculated by multiplying the unit price per kilogram of each recyclable item by the respective weight of the materials provided by the User.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>Plastic: If the unit price for plastic is ₹10 per kilogram and the User provides 10 kilograms of plastic, the amount payable would be ₹10 × 10 = ₹100.</p>
    <p>Iron: If the unit price for iron is ₹30 per kilogram and the User provides 15 kilograms of iron, the amount payable would be ₹30 × 15 = ₹450.</p>
    <p>In both cases, the total amount payable to the User would be based on the unit price and weight of the respective recyclable materials.</p>
